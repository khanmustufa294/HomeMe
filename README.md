## Overview
### Description
Enlists and views listings of real estate properties present in your choice of area on the map.It allows registered users and admins to post listings and provide the user a filtered search of best value properties.]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** 
	Real Estate/Bidding
- **Mobile:** 
	this app could be developed on any ios device and be almost as viable to build it on a computer. However mobile version gives the easy of access that computers fail to provide.

- **Story:**
	 A user can casually scan through the App to see the listings that have been uplaoded by the admin and registered brokers.If they wish to get further details they would have to login as a registered user if they wish to place a bid or contact the owner.

- **Market:**
	Any individual who just moved to the city or is looking for a change of apartment would be our target customers. 

- **Habit:**
	this app would be used by an individual until he finds his desired property. We also expect people who are real estate brokers to look for properties on our apps.

- **Scope:**
 	Initially we would begin with gathering listings from open source apis. The initial listings would help us gather some traffic on the website. We plan to inlcude rental properties to open the app to all the new customers who are looking to rent their spaces.
